🔐 Caesar Cipher – Prodigy Infotech Internship Project
This repository contains the implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique developed as part of my internship with Prodigy Infotech.
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

🚀 Project Highlights

🔄 Encryption & Decryption functionality using a customizable shift key

🧪 Interactive CLI for user input and testing

🧠 Simple yet effective demonstration of classical cryptography

📦 Clean and modular code structure for easy understanding and extension


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (or specify your language)

Basic string manipulation and control flow

📚 Learning Outcomes

Understanding of basic cryptographic principles

Hands-on experience with algorithm implementation

Improved coding and problem-solving skills


How it works:

You enter a message (any string).

You choose a shift value (e.g., 3).

The program prints:

The encrypted message (shifted by 3).

The decrypted version (correctly reversed back).


=== Caesar Cipher Program ===

Enter your message: Hello World!

Enter shift value (number): 3


--- Results ---

Original Message: Hello World!

Encrypted Message: Khoor Zruog!

Decrypted Message: Hello World!


Thank you!
